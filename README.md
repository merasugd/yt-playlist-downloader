# YouTube Playlist Downloader

A simple program to download YouTube playlists.

## Current Version
**v1.1.1-pre**

older versions can be downloaded thru releases

## Note
- The internet check might contribute to slowness. (it depends on your net, you can turn it off in the config).
- This program may be slow because it merges the audio and video downloads using `ffmpeg` and it also converts downloads to their specified format and edits the metadata of downloads using `ffmpeg`.
- The program can split downloads as an option on the config due to 'encoding errors,' videos without sound, unplayable videos, or because single-download quality is sh#t.

## Downloaders
- `split-v1`: Split Downloader V1
  - It uses purely ytdl-core and splits downloads to audio and video then merges it.

- `single-v1`: Single Downloader V1
  - It uses purely ytdl-core and downloads videos with attached audio to it. It doesnt need merging but sometimes the quality is sh#t.

- `split-v2`: Split Downloader V2
  - It uses fetch to gather sources, the difference between split v1 and v2 is v2 uses its own downloader [easydl]() and its incredibly fast.

- `single-v2`: Single Downloader V2
  - It uses ytdl-core to gather cources, single v2 also uses [easydl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/easydl).

- `anime-downloader`: Special Anime Downloader
  - It uses a provider to gather sources, this is a special downloader because it will never get updated again but still be fixed.
  - It is basically an anime downloader.
