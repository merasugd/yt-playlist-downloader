## Note
- The internet check might contribute to slowness. (it depends to your net).
- This program may be slow because it merges the audio and video downloads using `ffmpeg` and it also converts downloads to their specified format and edits the metadata of downloads using `ffmpeg`.
- The program can split downloads as an option on the config due to 'encoding errors,' videos without sound, unplayable videos, or because one-download quality is sh#t.
